# kanikeenkersttruiaan

kanikeenkersttruiaan is a web application based on the idea of `kanikeenkortebroekaan.nl`, which tells you whether you can wear shorts yet. This project will tell you if you can wear a Christmas sweater.

## Github Copilot Workspaces
Fun fact, this project is being made using Github Copilot Workspaces (technical preview) apart from some small tweaks like running the scaffolder and finding/uploading the images.

## Features

- A single page indicating whether you can wear a Christmas sweater.
- Displays a countdown to Christmas.

## Technologies Used

- Deno.js: A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is secure by default and comes with a built-in package manager.
- Fresh: A web framework for Deno that allows you to build web applications with server-side rendering and islands architecture.
- Deno Deploy: A hosting platform for Deno applications that provides seamless deployment and scaling.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Preact: A fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.
